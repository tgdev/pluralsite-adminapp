# Testing

## Frameworks

**Mocha**

**Chai**

## Setup

`/tools/testSetup.js`

Recursively looks for files in `/src/components`.

## Files

Test files are saved in the same location of the component they are testing.

eg: // `/src/components/home/`

They are differentiated from the component file by the `.test.js` suffix

eg: // `/src/components/home/home.test.js`
